        The Pakistan Association of Phonetics & Phonology Scholars (PAPPS) is a
        pioneering academic initiative dedicated to advancing the study,
        research, and teaching of Phonetics and Phonology in Pakistan. At a time
        when global scholarship in these fields is rapidly expanding, embracing
        experimental methods, acoustic analysis, speech technology, and
        interdisciplinary research, Pakistani academia has largely remained
        confined to textbook-based instruction and examination-oriented
        assessment. For decades, Phonetics and Phonology in Pakistan have been
        treated as peripheral subjects, often reduced to limited classroom
        coverage and a single 100-mark paper, with little emphasis on research,
        innovation, or real-world application. PAPPS emerges as a timely and
        necessary response to this long-standing academic gap. Committed to
        academic revival and intellectual progression, PAPPS aims to introduce
        contemporary and emerging research avenues to young scholars,
        researchers, and faculty members alike. Through webinars, training
        sessions, scholarly discussions, and collaborative platforms, the
        association works to bridge the gap between global research practices
        and local academic realities. Founded by ZA Jasra, a dedicated
        phonetician and academic, PAPPS reflects a deep-rooted passion for the
        discipline and a firm belief that Pakistani scholars deserve equal
        access to cutting-edge knowledge and research culture. More than an
        association, PAPPS represents a movement, one that seeks to reposition
        Phonetics and Phonology as central, dynamic, and research-driven fields
        within Pakistani academia. PAPPS stands for progress, relevance, and
        scholarly empowerment, reshaping how speech sciences are understood,
        taught, and researched in Pakistan.
